#BLS signature scheme

BLS signature scheme is a cryptographic algorithm based on bilinear mapping.
The description of the algorithm is not complicated, and it can be applied
to the design of verifiable random functions, with verifiability, randomness,
uniqueness and certainty.
Remember `e: G*G->G '`, is a non-degenerate bilinear mapping, `G` and `G '` is
the multiplication group of prime number `r` order, and the generator is `g`.
According to the nature of the bilinear mapping
```
e (g1^x, g2^y) = e (g1, g2)^(x * y)
```
and BLS signature includes three steps.

##KeyGen
Select a random integer `x` in [0, r-1] as the private key, `sk=x`, calculate
`pk = g^x` as the public key. `g` is the generator of the group `G`, As we know
`x` cannot be calculated from `pk`.

##Sign
message `m`, `h = Hash(m)`, `sign = h^x`

##Verify
Verifier known `G, g^x (pk), m` and `sign`. In order to verify the `sign = h^x`,
namely signature is generated by people with the private key `x`. the verifier
calculated `e(sign, g)` and `e(Hash(m), pk)`, and determine whether equal, equal
means verification pass.
```
because
  e (g1^x, g2^y) = e (g1, g2)^(x * y)

  e(sign, g) = e(h^x, g) = e(h, g)^x
  e(Hash(m), pk) = e(h, g^x) = e(h, g)^x

from the above we can know
  e(sign, g) = e(Hash(m), pk)
